你可以使用
"
pyinstaller -i lyy.ico gui.py
"
将项目构建为exe可执行文件
目前代码中有很多屎，比如给mac以及linux系统做的适配
但是这些代码从来没有真正在mac和linux系统测试过
也大概率不会用到
本项目开源版本更新至v2.5.8



You can use
"
pyinstaller -i lyy.ico gui.py
"
to build the project into an exe executable file. Currently, there is a lot of messy code, such as adaptations for Mac and Linux systems, but this code has never actually been tested on Mac or Linux, and is very unlikely to be used. The open-source version of this project has been updated to v2.5.8.
